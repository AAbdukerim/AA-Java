//Count the number of "xx" in the given string.
//We'll say that overlapping is allowed, so "xxx" contains 2 "xx".


int countXX(String str) {
  
  int count = 0;
  for(int i = 0; i < str.length()-1; i++){
    if (str.substring(i,i+2).equals("xx")) count++;
  }
  return count;
  
}

// Solution notes : the loop is shortened to end at str.length()-1
// So we can pull out a length 2 substring without going out of bounds.
// Remember to use equals() to compare string , not == ;
